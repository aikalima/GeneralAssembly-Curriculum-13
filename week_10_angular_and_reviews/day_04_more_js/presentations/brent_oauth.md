<h1>Oauth</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
  <br>
  <li>OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner, or end-user.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The client then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.</li>
  <br>
  <li>OAuth is commonly used as a way for web surfers to log into third party web sites using their Google, Facebook or Twitter accounts, without worrying about their access credentials being compromised.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Can be used with Java, PHP, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, Javascript</li>
